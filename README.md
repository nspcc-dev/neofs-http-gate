# NeoFS HTTP Protocol Gateway

NeoFS HTTP Protocol Gateway bridges NeoFS internal protocol and HTTP standard.
- you can download one file per request from NeoFS Network
- you can upload one file per request into the NeoFS Network

## Notable make targets

```
dep          Check and ensure dependencies
image        Build clean docker image
dirty-image  Build diry docker image with host-built binaries
fmts         Run all code formatters
lint         Run linters
version      Show current version
```

## Install

```go get -u github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-http-gate```

## File uploading behaviors

- you can upload on file per request
- if `FileName` not provided by Header attributes, multipart/form filename will be used instead

## Configuration

```

HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_TIME=duration                  - After a duration of this time if the client sees no activity
                                                   it pings the server to see if the transport is still alive 
HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=duration               - After having pinged for keepalive check, the client waits for a duration
                                                   of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection

HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_PERMIT_WITHOUT_STREAM=bool     - If true, client sends keepalive pings even with no active RPCs.
                                                   If false, when there are no active RPCs, Time and Timeout will be
                                                   ignored and no keepalive pings will be sent
